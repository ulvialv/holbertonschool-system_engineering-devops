A user wants to access the website and types “www.foobar.com” in their browser.

1. Domain Resolution
- The domain name “foobar.com” is registered and configured with a DNS A record:
  www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8
- The role of the domain name is to map a human-readable address to the server’s IP address.
- The “www” record is an A record (IPv4 mapping).

2. Single Server Infrastructure (IP: 8.8.8.8)
The entire website is hosted on one physical/virtual server. The server contains:

a) Web Server (Nginx)
- Receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from the user’s browser.
- Serves static content (CSS, JS, images).
- Forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

b) Application Server
- Runs the application code (business logic).
- Processes dynamic requests and generates HTML/JSON responses.

c) Application Files (Code Base)
- The code that implements the website’s logic.
- Executed by the application server.

d) Database (MySQL)
- Stores persistent data such as users, posts, or transactions.
- The application server communicates with MySQL for reading/writing data.

3. Communication
- The user's computer communicates with the server using HTTP/HTTPS over TCP.
- Nginx → Application Server (internal communication).
- Application Server → MySQL (local database connection).

4. Definitions
- Server: A machine that provides services/resources to clients over a network.
- Role of domain name: Converts readable names into IP addresses.
- Web server role: Handles HTTP traffic, serves static files, and forwards dynamic requests.
- Application server role: Runs the application logic and generates dynamic content.
- Database role: Stores structured persistent data.

5. Issues with this Infrastructure
a) SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
- Everything runs on one server.
- If the server goes down, the entire website becomes unavailable.

b) Downtime During Maintenance
- Deploying new code, rebooting services, updating packages, or restarting Nginx/MySQL
  causes downtime because the system has no redundancy.

c) Cannot Scale
- A single server cannot handle large traffic.
- CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and database load reach limits quickly.
- No load balancing or horizontal scaling possible.
